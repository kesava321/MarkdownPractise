If you paste a message from somewhere else

that

multiple lines,

you can quote that without having to manually prepend `>` to every line!

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
def function():
    #indenting works just fine in the fenced code block
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
s = "There is no highlighting for this."
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```diff
+With inline diffs tags you can display  {"additions"}  or  ["deletions"] .
-Test removal
```

```diff
The wrapping tags can be either curly braces or square brackets  {"additions"}  or  ["deletions"] .
```

```diff
However the wrapping tags cannot be mixed as such:

{+ additions +]
[+ additions +}
{- deletions -]
[- deletions -}

```

``` 
Sometimes you want to :monkey: around a bit and add some :star2: to your :speech_balloon:. Well we have a gift for you:

:zap: You can use emoji anywhere GFM is supported. :v:

You can use it to point out a :bug: or warn about :speak_no_evil: patches. And if someone improves your really :snail: code, send them some :birthday:. People will :heart: you for that.

If you are new to this, don't be :fearful:. You can easily join the emoji :family:. All you need to do is to look up on the supported codes.

Consult the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://emoji.codes) for a list of all supported emoji codes. :thumbsup:
